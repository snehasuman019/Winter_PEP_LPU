1. you are given a string as you must convert it into a integer following some strict rules :-
  ignore leading spaces
  check signs 
  read digits until unknown digit is found .
  if number goes out of the int range you have to use char range 
  if number goes out of the range you have to clamp it 
  if no digits just return 0.
  sample : Hello123
  output : 0
  sample : 12@Hello34511
  output : 12
  sample : 12@1244
  output : 12


2.there is a camera on a toll gate that keeps track of the vehicles passing every minute . Find the maximum vehicles passed in k consecutive minutes . 
  input : You are given with an array and k 
  output : Maximum number of vehicles passed in k consecutive minutes .
  ex : [3,5,13,,8,12,5,18,2]          k=3
  

3. A mall record customer entries every hour . you are given an array where each element represents customers entering in that hour . find the maximum customer in k consecutive hours.
 input : arr = [2,1,5,1,3,2]          k =3              possible output = 9

4. A finance app records daily profits and check if there exist a continuous periods whose sum equals target s.
 input : arr = [1,4,20,3,10,5]
 output : 20,3,10
 s = 33 
 Do this for negative numbers as well 


5. A factory tracks energy usage per hour . find the minimum sum of any k continuous hours 
  input : arr = {10,20,30,40,50}      k = 2


6. You have power ratings , find the smallest subarray whose sum is greater than equal to target. 
  Input : arr [2,3,1,2,4,3]          target : k = 7 
  Output: 2(length of subarray)

7. Network latency logs are given find the longest subarray with atmost two distinct values. 
  Input : arr = [1,2,1,2,3]          
  Output : 4


8. Find the number of subarray whose sum is exactly k .
  Input : arr = [ 1,1,1]            k = 3
  Output : 

9. Given a sorted array, check if two numbers sum to X 
  Input : arr = [1,2,4,6,10]        x = 8
  Output : true if 2 , other false
