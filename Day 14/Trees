TREES
1. Binary Tree 
    - Full Binary Tree –> every node has either 0 or 2 children.
    - Complete Binary Tree – all levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to  
                             right.
    - Balanced Binary Tree – height difference between left and right subtrees of every node is minimal
2. BST (binary search tree)
    - elements at left -> less than the root
    - elements at right -> greater than the root
3. DFS Traversals
4.
